Age and Gender Prediction from Facial Images-
Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning model capable of predicting the age and gender of individuals from facial images. Leveraging state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and image processing techniques, the model learns to analyze facial features and make accurate predictions.

Features
Predicts age and gender from facial images
Uses a CNN architecture for feature extraction and classification
Trained on a diverse dataset covering a wide range of ages and genders
Provides reliable predictions in real-time
Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset of facial images sourced from various sources. The dataset includes images spanning different age groups and genders to ensure robustness and generalization.

Usage
Data Preprocessing: Before training the model, ensure that your dataset is properly preprocessed. This includes tasks such as resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Train the deep learning model using the provided dataset. Fine-tune the model architecture and hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model on a separate test dataset to assess its accuracy and performance. Analyze metrics such as accuracy, mean absolute error (MAE), and loss to gauge the model's effectiveness.
Prediction: Use the trained model to make predictions on new facial images. Provide input images to the model and obtain predictions for age and gender.
