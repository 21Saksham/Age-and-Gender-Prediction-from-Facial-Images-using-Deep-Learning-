UTKFace Age and Gender Prediction-
This project leverages the UTKFace dataset to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for predicting age and gender from grayscale images. The dataset contains over 20,000 face images labeled with age, gender, and ethnicity. The provided script sets up the necessary environment, processes the dataset, and constructs a CNN model using Keras. Key steps include extracting image paths and labels, normalizing pixel values, and splitting the data into training and testing sets. The CNN model features multiple convolutional and max-pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers, and is trained to predict both age and gender simultaneously.

To run the project, ensure the UTKFace dataset is in the correct directory structure and install the required libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, PIL, tensorflow, keras, scikit-learn, tqdm). Execute the age_gender_prediction.py script to load the dataset, preprocess the images, train the model, and evaluate its predictions. The script also includes visualization of age distribution and displays an example image with its original and predicted labels. This approach provides a comprehensive framework for age and gender prediction using deep learning techniques.
